      "- From point 1: A is on top of E. So, the stack becomes C → E → A.\n",
      "- From point 5: F is on top of A. So, the stack is C → E → A → F.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, looking at points 2 and 3:\n",
      "\n",
      "- B is on top of D (point 2).\n",
      "- C is on top of B (point 3). So, the stack is D → B → C.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, C is already part of the other stack (C → E → A → F). That's a problem because a block can't be in two places simultaneously. So, there must be a misunderstanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the goal is to have two separate stacks:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. One stack: E → C → B → D\n",
      "2. Another stack: A → F\n",
      "\n",
      "But that doesn't fit with the goal statements. Alternatively, maybe the goal is a single stack where:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The bottom is E, then C, then B, then D, then A, then F.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that would mean:\n",
      "\n",
      "E → C → B → D → A → F\n",
      "\n",
      "But the goal states that A is on top of E, which would mean E is directly under A, not with C in between. So, perhaps the goal is:\n",
      "\n",
      "- A is on top of E, which is on the table.\n",
      "- B is on top of D, which is on the table.\n",
      "- C is on top of B.\n",
      "- E is on top of C.\n",
      "- F is on top of A.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, that still doesn't make sense because E can't be both on top of C and under A unless C is under E, which is under A. So, the stack would be C → E → A, and F on top of A. Meanwhile, B is on top of D, and C is on top of B. But again, C can't be in two places.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I'm getting confused. Let me try to represent the goal as a set of blocks with their supports:\n",
      "\n",
      "- A is supported by E.\n",
      "- E is supported by C.\n",
      "- C is supported by B.\n",
      "- B is supported by D.\n",
      "- F is supported by A.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the stack would be D → B → C → E → A → F.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the goal also states that B is on top of D, which fits, and C is on top of B, which fits. E is on top of C, which fits, and A is on top of E, which fits. F is on top of A, which fits.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the final stack should be D → B → C → E → A → F.\n",
      "\n",
      "But initially, we have:\n",
      "\n",
      "- F → B → D → C\n",
      "- A and E on the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the initial stacks are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. F (table) → B → D → C\n",
      "2. A (table)\n",
      "3. E (table)\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal is to rearrange them into a single stack: D → B → C → E → A → F.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but D is currently on top of B, which is on F. So, to get D to the bottom, we need to move B and D.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me outline the steps needed:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. We need to move C off D to make D clear.\n",
      "2. Then, move D off B to make B clear.\n",
      "3. Then, move B off F to make F clear.\n",
      "4. Then, stack D on the table.\n",
      "5. Stack B on D.\n",
      "6. Stack C on B.\n",
      "7. Stack E on C.\n",
      "8. Stack A on E.\n",
      "9. Stack F on A.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let's check the initial state:\n",
      "\n",
      "- F is on the table, with B on top, D on top of B, and C on top of D.\n",
      "- A and E are on the table, clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, to start, we need to unstack C from D. But to do that, we need to pick up C, which is clear. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Unstack C from D.\n",
      "2. Put down C.\n",
      "Now, D is clear (since C was on top, and now it's removed).\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, we need to unstack D from B. But D is now clear, so:\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Unstack D from B.\n",
      "4. Put down D.\n",
      "Now, B is clear.\n",

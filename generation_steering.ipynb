      "- F is on top of C.\n",
      "- G is on top of A.\n",

      "- G is on top of A.\n",
      "- D is on top of B.\n",
      "- B is on top of G. Wait, that can't be right because if B is on top of G, and G is on top of A, then B would be above G, which is above A. But D is on top of B, so the stack would be D on B on G on A.\n",
      "\n",

That seems like a tall stack.\n",

      "Wait, but the goal also says G is on top of A, which is correct because A is on the table. So G is on A, then B on G, D on B, C on D, F on C, E on F. So the final stack would be E-F-C-D-B-G-A. But that seems like a lot of blocks stacked, but let's see.\n",

      "First, I need to get G from on top of C to on top of A. But G is on C, which is on E. So I need to unstack G from C, but to do that, I need to have C clear. Currently, C has G on top, so C is not clear. So I need to unstack G first.\n",

Wait, but the initial conditions say G is clear, so that means G has nothing on top of it, but it's on top of C, which is on E. So C is under G, but C is not clear because G is on top. So to unstack G, I need to pick up G, but to do that, I need to have my hand empty, which it is. So I can unstack G from C.\n",

      "\n",
      "After that, G is in hand, and C is now clear because G was on top. Then I can put down G somewhere. But where? The goal is to have G on top of A. So I need to stack G on A. But A currently has D on top. So I need to move D first.\n",
      "\n",
      "But D is on A, and D is clear. So I can unstack D from A. But to do that, I need to have my hand empty. After unstacking G, I have G in hand, so I can't unstack D yet. So I need to put down G first.\n",
      "\n",
      "So step 2: put down G. Now, G is on the table, and my hand is empty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I can unstack D from A. So step 3: unstack D from A. Now, D is in hand, and A is clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, I can stack D on B, but wait, the goal requires D to be on top of B, which is on top of G, which is on A. So perhaps I need to stack D on B later. But let's see.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the goal is:\n",

      "Wait, after step 9, D is on B on G on A. So I can stack C on D.\n",

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.

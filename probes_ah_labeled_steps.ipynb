      "Okay, so I have this block stacking problem to solve. Let me try to figure out the steps needed to get from the initial state to the goal state. I'll take it step by step because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let me understand the initial conditions. The problem says:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Block B is clear.\n",
      "- Block C is clear.\n",
      "- The hand is empty.\n",
      "- Block A is on top of Block E.\n",
      "- Block B is on top of Block D.\n",
      "- Block D is on top of Block A.\n",
      "- Block C is on the table.\n",
      "- Block E is on the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, visualizing this, I think the stacks are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "- E is on the table.\n",
      "- A is on top of E.\n",
      "- D is on top of A.\n",
      "- B is on top of D.\n",
      "- C is on the table, clear.\n",

      "And the goal is:\n",
      "\n",
      "- A is on top of D.\n",
      "- C is on top of A.\n",
      "- D is on top of E.\n",
      "- E is on top of B.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me parse the goal again:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Block A is on top of Block D, Block C is on top of Block A, Block D is on top of Block E and Block E is on top of Block B.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "- D is on top of E.\n",
      "- A is on top of D.\n",

      "But wait, initially, E is on the table, A is on E, D is on A, B is on D. So the initial stack is B on D on A on E, and C is separate on the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no. Let me correct that. The initial conditions say:\n",

      "- C on A,\n",
      "- D on E,\n",
      "- E on B.\n",

      "Wait, but initially, B is on D, which is on A, which is on E. So, to get E on B, I need to move E under B, but E is currently under A and D. So, I need to move E from under A to on top of B.\n",
      "\n",
      "But E is currently supporting A, which is supporting D, which is supporting B. So, to move E, I need to first move everything above it, which is A, D, and B. But B is on D, which is on A, which is on E. So, to get E on B, I need to have B on the table, then put E on B, then stack D on E, then A on D, and finally C on A.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let's break it down step by step.\n",
      "\n",

      "- B is clear.\n",

      "But since E is under A, which is under D, which is under B, I need to unstack B first, then D, then A, then E can be moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but E is on the table, so to move E, I need to pick it up, but E is under A, so A is on E. So, to pick up E, I need to have A removed from E. So, I need to unstack A from E, but A is under D and B. So, I need to unstack B first, then D, then A, then E can be moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me outline the steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Unstack B from D. But wait, B is on D, which is on A, which is on E. So, to unstack B, I need to have D clear. But D has B on top, so I can unstack B from D.\n",

      "\n",
      "5. Now, A is clear, so I can unstack A from E. Step 5: Unstack A from E. Now, A is in hand, E is clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Put down A on the table. Now, A is on the table, clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Now, E is clear, so I can pick up E. Step 7: Pick up E.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Stack E on top of B. Now, E is on B, which is on the table. So, B has E on top.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Now, I need to stack D on E. So, pick up D. But D is on the table, clear. So, step 9: Pick up D.\n",

      "11. Now, stack A on D. So, pick up A. A is on the table, clear. Step 11: Pick up A.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. Stack A on D. Now, A is on D, which is on E, which is on B.\n",
      "\n",
      "13. Finally, stack C on A. C is on the table, clear. So, step 13: Pick up C.\n",

      "14. Stack C on A. Now, C is on A, which is on D, which is on E, which is on B.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but let me check if all the steps are valid according to the rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me go through each step:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Unstack B from D: Yes, because B is on D, and B is clear (since it's the top block). Hand is empty, so I can unstack B. After this, B is in hand, D is clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Put down B: Now, B is on the table, clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Unstack D from A: D is on A, and D is clear (since B was just removed). So, I can unstack D. Now, D is in hand, A is clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Put down D: D is on the table, clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Unstack A from E: A is on E, and A is clear (since D was just removed). So, I can unstack A. Now, A is in hand, E is clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Put down A: A is on the table, clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Pick up E: E is on the table, clear. So, I can pick it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Stack E on B: B is on the table, clear. So, I can stack E on B. Now, E is on B, which is on the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Pick up D: D is on the table, clear. So, I can pick it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Stack D on E: E is on B, clear (since nothing is on top of E). So, I can stack D on E. Now, D is on E, which is on B.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. Pick up A: A is on the table, clear. So, I can pick it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. Stack A on D: D is on E, clear (since nothing is on top of D). So, I can stack A on D. Now, A is on D, which is on E, which is on B.\n",
      "\n",
      "13. Pick up C: C is on the table, clear. So, I can pick it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "14. Stack C on A: A is on D, clear (since nothing is on top of A). So, I can stack C on A. Now, C is on A, which is on D, which is on E, which is on B.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but in the initial state, Block C is on the table and clear. So, in step 13, I can pick up C because it's clear. Then stack it on A, which is clear after step 12.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let me check if all the intermediate steps are valid. For example, after step 8, E is on B, which is on the table. Then, in step 9, I pick up D, which is on the table. Then stack D on E, which is on B. Then pick up A, stack on D, then pick up C, stack on A.\n",

      "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to rearrange some blocks. Let me try to figure out the steps I need to take. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, let me understand the initial setup. The blocks are A, B, C, D. The initial conditions are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Block A is clear.\n",
      "- Block B is clear.\n",
      "- Hand is empty.\n",
      "- Block A is on top of Block D.\n",
      "- Block B is on top of Block C.\n",
      "- Block C is on the table.\n",
      "- Block D is on the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, visualizing this, I have two separate stacks. One stack is D with A on top, and another stack is C with B on top. Both D and C are on the table. \n",
      "\n",
      "My goal is to have:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Block A on top of Block D.\n",
      "- Block B on top of Block C.\n",
      "- Block D on top of Block B.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me parse that again. The goal is:\n",
      "\n",
      "- A is on D.\n",
      "- B is on C.\n",
      "- D is on B.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the final arrangement should be a stack where D is on B, which is on C, and A is on D. So the order from bottom to top would be C, B, D, A. But wait, that can't be because D is on B, which is on C, and A is on D. So the stack would be C, B, D, A. But initially, A is on D, which is on the table, and B is on C, which is on the table. So I need to move D to be on top of B, which is on C, and then A remains on D.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the goal says Block A is on top of Block D, which is on top of Block B, which is on top of Block C. So the final stack is C, B, D, A. But initially, A is on D, and B is on C. So I need to move D from the table to on top of B, which is on C. But D is currently under A, so I can't move D until I move A off of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the steps I need to take are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Move A off of D. Since A is clear, I can unstack A from D. Then put A down somewhere, maybe on the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Then, I can pick up D and stack it on top of B, which is on C. But wait, B is on C, which is on the table. So I need to have D on top of B, which is on C. So first, I need to have B clear so I can stack D on it. But B is already on C, which is on the table. So I can unstack B from C, but wait, B is clear, so I can unstack it. But if I unstack B, I can put it down, then stack D on C, but that's not the goal. The goal is D on B, which is on C.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe I should first move B off of C so that I can stack D on B. But B is clear, so I can unstack B from C, put it down, then stack D on B, then stack B on C. Hmm, but that might complicate things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps I can move A first. Let me outline the steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Unstack A from D. Now, A is in hand, D is on the table.\n",
      "- Put down A. Now, A is on the table, D is on the table, B is on C, which is on the table.\n",
      "- Now, I need to stack D on B. But B is on C, which is on the table. So I can unstack B from C, put B down, then stack D on C, but that's not the goal. The goal is D on B, which is on C.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe I should stack D on B while B is still on C. But can I do that? Let me think. To stack D on B, B must be clear. Since B is on C, and nothing is on top of B, it's clear. So I can pick up D and stack it on B. But D is on the table now, so I can pick it up and stack it on B.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but after unstacking A, D is on the table. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Unstack A from D. Hand holds A, D is on table.\n",
      "2. Put down A. Now, A is on table, D is on table, B is on C, which is on table.\n",
      "3. Now, pick up D. Hand holds D.\n",
      "4. Stack D on B. Now, D is on B, which is on C. So the stack is C, B, D. But the goal is D on B, which is on C, and A on D. So now, I have C, B, D. Then I need to stack A on D.\n",
      "\n",
      "But A is on the table. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Pick up A.\n",
      "6. Stack A on D. Now, the stack is C, B, D, A. Which matches the goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but let me check the goal again: Block A is on top of Block D, Block B is on top of Block C, and Block D is on top of Block B. So yes, that's correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, in step 3, when I pick up D, is D clear? Yes, because after unstacking A, D is on the table and clear. So I can pick it up. Then stack it on B, which is on C and clear. So that's allowed.\n",
      "\n",

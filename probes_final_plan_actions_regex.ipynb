      "Okay, so I have this block stacking problem to solve. Let me try to figure out the steps needed to get from the initial state to the goal state. I'll take it step by step because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of problems.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "First, let me understand the initial conditions. The blocks are arranged as follows:\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "- Block A is on top of Block B.\n",
      "- Block C is on top of Block A.\n",
      "- Block D is on top of Block C.\n",
      "- Block F is on top of Block E.\n",
      "- Blocks B and E are on the table.\n",
      "- Blocks D and F are clear, meaning they have nothing on top of them.\n",
      "- The hand is empty.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "So, visually, the stacks look like this:\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Stack 1: B (on table) → A → C → D (clear)\n",
      "Stack 2: E (on table) → F (clear)\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "And the goal is to have:\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "- A on top of E\n",
      "- C on top of D\n",
      "- D on top of B\n",
      "- E on top of C\n",
      "- F on top of A\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me parse the goal again:\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Goal:\n",
      "- Block A is on top of Block E\n",
      "- Block C is on top of Block D\n",
      "- Block D is on top of Block B\n",
      "- Block E is on top of Block C\n",
      "- Block F is on top of Block A\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Hmm, that's a bit of a loop. Let me try to visualize the desired final stacks.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "From the goal, Block E is on top of Block C, which is on top of Block D, which is on top of Block B. So that stack would be B → D → C → E. Then, Block A is on top of E, so E → A. And Block F is on top of A, so A → F.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Wait, but that would mean E is both on top of C and under A, which is on top of E. That seems impossible because E can't be both above and below A. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the goal.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Wait, let me read the goal again carefully:\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Block A is on top of Block E, Block C is on top of Block D, Block D is on top of Block B, Block E is on top of Block C and Block F is on top of Block A.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "So, the relationships are:\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "A on E\n",
      "C on D\n",
      "D on B\n",
      "E on C\n",
      "F on A\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "So, putting this together:\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Starting from the bottom, Block B has D on top, D has C on top, C has E on top, E has A on top, and A has F on top. So the stack would be B → D → C → E → A → F.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "But wait, that's a single stack. But initially, we have two stacks: B → A → C → D and E → F. So the goal is to merge these into one stack where B is at the bottom, then D, then C, then E, then A, then F.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "But how do we get there? Let's think about the steps needed.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "First, let's note the initial state:\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "- Stack 1: B (table) → A → C → D (clear)\n",
      "- Stack 2: E (table) → F (clear)\n",
      "- Hand is empty.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "We need to move blocks around to achieve the goal. Let's list the goal stack as B → D → C → E → A → F.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "So, starting from the initial state, we need to move D from on top of C to on top of B. But D is currently on top of C, which is on top of A, which is on top of B. So to move D, we need to unstack it from C, but C is on top of A, which is on top of B.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Wait, but to unstack D from C, we need to have D clear, which it is, but we also need to have C clear. Currently, C has D on top, so C is not clear. So we can't unstack D from C unless we first unstack something else.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Wait, no. The initial state says Block D is clear, which means D has nothing on top of it. So D is clear, but C is under D, so C is not clear because D is on top of it. So to unstack D from C, we need to have C clear, which it isn't. So we can't do that directly.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "So perhaps we need to move C first. But C is under D, so to move C, we need to unstack it from A. But C is on top of A, so to unstack C, we need A to be clear. But A has C on top, so A isn't clear. So we can't unstack C from A unless we first unstack D from C, but we can't do that because C isn't clear.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "This seems like a problem. Maybe we need to move A first. A is on top of B, so to unstack A, we need B to be clear. But B has A on top, so B isn't clear. So we can't unstack A unless we first unstack something from A, but A has C on top, so we can't unstack A unless we first unstack C, which requires C to be clear, which it isn't because D is on top.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "This is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this by looking at the goal and working backwards.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "The goal requires that D is on top of B. So we need to move D from its current position (on top of C) to on top of B. But to do that, we need to have B clear. Currently, B has A on top, so we need to move A somewhere else.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Where can A go? The goal says A is on top of E. So perhaps we can move A to E. But E is on the table with F on top. So to put A on E, we need to have E clear. Currently, E has F on top, so we need to move F first.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "So step 1: Unstack F from E. But F is clear, so we can unstack it. So:\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "1. Unstack F from E.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Now, F is in hand, E is clear.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",

      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "After step 5, D is on B.\n",

      "Then, we need to move C on top of D.\n",

      "6. Stack C on D: valid, D is clear.\n",
      "7. Unstack F from A: Wait, after step 5, A is still on E, right? Because we haven't moved A yet. So after step 6, the stacks are:\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "- B → D → C\n",
      "- E → A → F\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "So to move E's stack, we need to unstack A and F first.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "So step 7: Unstack F from A: valid, F is clear.\n",
      "8. Put down F: valid.\n",

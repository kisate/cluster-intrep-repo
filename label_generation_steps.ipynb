      "So, the final arrangement should be a stack where D is on B, which is on C, and A is on D. So the order from bottom to top would be C, B, D, A.

      "=========\n",
      "But wait, in step 3, when I pick up D, is D clear? Yes, because after unstacking A, D is on the table and clear. So I can pick it up. Then stack it on B, which is on C and clear. So that's allowed.\n",
